#Project Background
Crime is a prominent issue in South Africa as it is all over the world, 
Many criminal activities go unresolved or even attended to due to the lack of evidence or concrete witnesses. 
Mobile applications have become increasingly popular all over the world and are used in our everyday and work life for common things such as checking the weather;
maps for directions and news feed updates. Digital forensic science hopes to utilise this increasing growth in the use of mobile applications to address the lack of evidence to crime cases in South Africa. 
The application is referred to as Online Neighbour- hood Watch(ONW) accessible via mobile devices and computers over the internet. 
The two main users of the ONW model are the uploader (user of the mobile device) and the forensic investigator or law enforcement agent. 
This tool is to be used by the citizens of South Africa to capture, collect and store potential evidence which can later be viewed and analysed by the Police department and used in the prosecution and detention of criminals.

#Project Scope
The Scope of the ONW is too broad and with the time allocated to the team for this project we decided to focus on only one element of the application, 
users will only upload pictures as evidence for now and disregard the video and audio part of the ONW model.
There are three aspects of the system the mobile application side, utilised by a community member; the desktop side where a law enforcement agent logs in and the algorithm which sits in between the mobile and desktop. The algorithm will be used to determine if the photo uploaded is a crime photo.
we will focus on human and object detection for now and maybe at a later stage if time permits other media could be uploaded as well.
